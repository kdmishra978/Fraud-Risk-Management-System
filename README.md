# Fraud Risk Management System For UPI Transactions

This Project is mainly focused on the fraud risk management of UPI transactions which generates a risk score after analyzing the customer's past transaction habits using Maching Learning and Data Analysis. 

Once the risk score is generated the customer's bank decides whether that particular transaction should be flagged as fraud or not. 
The MySQL database was integrated with the jupyter notebook using pyodbc which is an open source python module. The database file was then converted into a dataframe. After manipulating the dataframe and aquiring the necessary attributes, our machine learning model was trained.

Further the code in the "Final file" was deployed using the AWS cloud environment and the "lambda file" was created to transfer the data using API in the backend and a risk score was generated by the model. POSTMAN was used to execute the API to send the transaction details and fetch the risk score.
